# ManchuDictionary

This is a small project to put a well-designed, feature-rich Manchu dictionary online.

Manchu was one of the official languages of the Qing dynasty, but today it is an almost extinct language, with very few native speakers left. Manchu has a distinctive
and elegant script, which can often be seen alongside Chinese characters on old buildings in China. One of the aims of this app is to help English speakers engage
with the language, possibly learning to read the script and understand a few basic words and sentences.
